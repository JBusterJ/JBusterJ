## Hi, I'm Einstein

###### Just kidding, I'm not, unfortunately. But I do a lot of cool stuff. But usually I don't post it on GitHub, which kind of defeats the purpose of my GitHub account. 

### Who am I?
I am JB! (real name not mentioned because I would not like for my name to be on a public about-me).
My hobbies include Astronomy, Physics, Mathematics, and droning. You may find hints of these hobbies in some of my GitHub repositories! Most of my GitHub projects are programmed in JavaScript, although outside of GitHub I program in a variety of languages including C# and Python.

Here are my GitHub stats. Keep in mind I mainly use GitHub to store demos of projects I was making (normally for fun) so don't expect contributions and stars earned to be high for now.

SOME of my projects (other projects on my GitHub not featured below are probably works-in-progress and aren't completely polished. Other projects may not be on GitHub altogether)

#### What things am I planning to add to my GitHub?  
Currently, I am working on more scientifically inclined projects, ranging from a fractal generator, to a mid-high featured calculator (with features including solving complex equations including summations, and so on). Other projects I am also working on involve scientifically accurate planetary simulations (v2) which will come packed with a lot more information than there is in the current version (current version containing basic information such as orbital period, semi-major axis, semi-minor axis, eccentricity, and so on). I intend on making more physics simulators as well, including vehicle physics (hooke's law with accurate wheel physics) and softbody physics, for example. All of these might be added to a self-coded physics engine, which are extremely hard to make according to my research, but I may give it a try.
